# gNMI Subscribe Client

A simple shell binary that performs gNMI Subscribe client operations against a gNMI target.

## gNMI Subscribe Operations

There are 3 subscription modes that can be used:

* **ONCE** by using `-once`. In this mode, the target generates the requested update messages, transmits them, and then closes the RPC.

* **POLL** by using `-poll`. In this mode, the target generates and transmits updates when requested by the client.

* **STREAM** is used by default when neither of the flags above are set. In this mode, data can be streamed:
	* Periodically, using `-sample_interval`. 
		* `-heartbeat_interval` can be used, which specifies an interval, during which the target is forced to generate a telemetry update.
	* On change, using `-stream_on_change`
		* `-suppress_redundant` can be used, which means that updates are only generated for those individual leaf nodes in the subscription that have changed.
        * `-heartbeat_interval` can be used, which specifies an interval, during which the target is forced to generate a telemetry update.
	* If neither flag is set then the target determines the best subscription type.
